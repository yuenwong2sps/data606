### Data Preparation


```{r load-and-prepare-data}
#All collision by date
#CollisionByDate <- tbl_df(read.csv("109PoliceMotorCollisionWeatherData.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE))

#get subset, weather = rainy
bad_date_Collision <- as.data.frame(c())
#bad_date_Collision <- subset(CollisionByDate, WT = "01" | "02" | "03".... )

#WT** = Weather Type where ** has one of the following values:	   
#                  01 = Fog, ice fog, or freezing fog (may include heavy fog)
#                  02 = Heavy fog or heaving freezing fog (not always 
#		       distinguished from fog)
  
#                  03 = Thunder
#                  04 = Ice pellets, sleet, snow pellets, or small hail 
#                  05 = Hail (may include small hail)
#                  06 = Glaze or rime 
#                  07 = Dust, volcanic ash, blowing dust, blowing sand, or blowing obstruction
#                  08 = Smoke or haze 
#                  09 = Blowing or drifting snow
#                  10 = Tornado, waterspout, or funnel cloud 
#                  11 = High or damaging winds
#                  12 = Blowing spray
#                  13 = Mist
#                  14 = Drizzle
#                  15 = Freezing drizzle 
#                  16 = Rain (may include freezing rain, drizzle, and freezing drizzle) 
#                  17 = Freezing rain 
#                  18 = Snow, snow pellets, snow grains, or ice crystals
#                  19 = Unknown source of precipitation 
#                  21 = Ground fog 
#                  22 = Ice fog or freezing fog

### Research question 

Does car accident is predictable by weather conditions?

109 Precinct in Flushing, NY (https://goo.gl/maps/9aPSt9yqDp42), from one of my previous project I found that  has most of the car accidents in entire New York City (http://rpubs.com/nyjon2k/316465/) #3 "NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions" section.  Therefore, I am interested: Does the weather condition lead to more car accidents?  For example, there will be more vehicle collosion in rainy day while there will be more pedestrian and cyclists killed.

Research question:
For bad weather date (weather type = rain, fog, or ice ), What will be car accident frequency be in 109 Police station?


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**

Each case represent the sum of the car accidents in a rainy date. `r nrow(rainydate)` observations in the given data set.


### Data collection 



1) NYPD Moter Vehicle Collison Data is maintained by NYPD department
(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions-07420)

2) National Ocean and Atmosperic Adiminstration (NOAA) Historical data.
(https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/past-weather-zip-code-data-table)



### Type of study 

This is an observational study.


### Data Source 

I am going to download 2 dataset and merge them together by date before analysis.

Both data set are daily data.

NYPD Moter Vehicle Collision Data can be queried with URL/JSON request:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/h9gi-nx95/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD


NOAA historical data: 
weather data of area near 109 police station. (https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/past-weather-zip-code-data-table).  Data can be collected with zip code or country information.


Data defination could be found:

### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The response variable is car accident frequency per day and is numerical.


### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**

The explanatory variable is weather condition and is categorival.


### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

I plan to include histogram of the car accidents and determine if it is normal distribution

If the distribution is normal, i would find out the 95% confident intervals.
