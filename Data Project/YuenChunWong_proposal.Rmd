### Data Preparation


```{r load-and-prepare-data}
#All collision by date
#CollisionByDate <- tbl_df(read.csv("109PoliceMotorCollisionWeatherData.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE))

#get subset, weather = rainy
bad_date_Collision <- as.data.frame(c())
#bad_date_Collision <- subset(CollisionByDate, PRCP > 0 || snow > 0 .... )


#NOAA data
#WSF2 - Fastest 2-minute wind speed
#WSF5 - Fastest 5-second wind speed
#SNOW - Snowfall
#WT03 - Thunder
#WESF - Water equivalent of snowfall
#WT04 - Ice pellets, sleet, snow pellets, or small hail" 
#PRCP - Precipitation
#WT06 - Glaze or rime 
#WT08 - Smoke or haze 
#SNWD - Snow depth
#WT09 - Blowing or drifting snow
#WDF2 - Direction of fastest 2-minute wind
#AWND - Average wind speed
#WDF5 - Direction of fastest 5-second wind
#WT01 - Fog, ice fog, or freezing fog (may include heavy fog)
#TMAX - Maximum temperature
#WT02 - Heavy fog or heaving freezing fog (not always distinguished from fog)
#TAVG - Average Temperature.
#TMIN - Minimum temperature


```


### Research question 

Does car accident is predictable by weather conditions?

109 Precinct in Flushing, NY (https://goo.gl/maps/9aPSt9yqDp42), from one of my previous project I found that  has most of the car accidents in entire New York City (http://rpubs.com/nyjon2k/316465/) #3 "NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions" section.  Therefore, I am interested: Does the weather condition lead to more car accidents?  For example, there will be more vehicle collosion in rainy day while there will be more pedestrian and cyclists killed.

Research question:
For bad weather date (weather type = rain, fog, or ice ), What will be car accident frequency be in 109 Police station?


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**

Each case represent the sum of the car accidents in a rainy date. `r nrow(rainydate)` observations in the given data set.


### Data collection 



1) NYPD Moter Vehicle Collison Data is maintained by NYPD department
(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions-07420)

2) National Ocean and Atmosperic Adiminstration (NOAA) Historical data.
(https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/past-weather-zip-code-data-table)



### Type of study 

This is an observational study.


### Data Source 

I am going to download 2 dataset and merge them together by date before analysis.

Both data set are daily data.

NYPD Moter Vehicle Collision Data can be queried with URL/JSON request:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/h9gi-nx95/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD


NOAA historical data: 
weather data of area near 109 police station. (https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/past-weather-zip-code-data-table).  Data can be collected with zip code or country information.


Data defination could be found:

### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The response variable is car accident frequency per day and is numerical.


### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**

The explanatory variable is weather condition and is categorival.


### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

I plan to include histogram of the car accidents and determine if it is normal distribution

If the distribution is normal, i would find out the 95% confident intervals.
